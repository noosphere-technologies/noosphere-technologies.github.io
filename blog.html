</h2>
                    <p id="date">February 1, 2024</p>
                    <p>Digital journalism, specifically local news, is quietly undergoing a renaissance. While many observers harp on the problems of mainstream versus social media, there is a tremendous amount of innovation, and even increasing subscription revenue, in local journalism. This motion will undoubtedly accelerate in 2024 with the backing of <a href="https://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/press-forward-will-award-more-than-500-million-to-revitalize-local-news">Press Forward</a>, which bills itself as "a national initiative to strengthen communities and democracy by supporting local news and information with an infusion of <b>more than a half-billion dollars</b> over the next five years." </a>
</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.404media.co/">404 Media</a> is representative of the transformation in local journalism.  They describe themselves as a “journalist-founded digital media company exploring the ways technology is shaping–and is shaped by–our world.” Somewhat ironically, emerging <b>technology, in the form of AI, is also an existential threat</b>.
</p>
                    <p>It turns out that <b>AI tools are eating local journalism</b>. 404 Media's <a href="https://www.404media.co/about/">founders</a>, recently explained their predicament in a post, <a href="https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/">AI Spam Is Eating the Internet, Stealing Our Work, and Destroying Discoverability</a>.</p>
                    <p>“Over the last few weeks Jason has been researching and experimenting with a series of AI tools that promise to ‘spin’ articles for their users. One, called SpinRewriter, lets users create 1,000 slightly different versions of the same article with a single click and to automatically publish them to as many WordPress sites as you want using a paid plugin. It also offers a tool that lets users manage as many websites as they want from a single dashboard.”</p>     
					
					<p>On their website, Spinrewriter boldly proclaims that their service "produces the kind of articles where there's absolutely <b>NO way to tell they were created by an AI.</b>"</p>
					
					<p>The problem, of course, is not limited to scrappy startups like 404 Media. Sam Harris, the philosopher, neuroscientist, podcast host and author, recently proclaimed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmlrEgLGozw">podcast interview</a> that “<b>the internet will die because of AI</b>.”</p>
					
										<iframe width="420" height="315" align="center"
					 					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmlrEgLGozw">
					 					</iframe>
					
					<p>But is there a positive side to this dire picture of an AI-driven information apocalypse? According to Andrew Golis, “There will be silver linings to <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/12/the-robots-will-make-us-more-human/">The Great Robot Spam Flood of 2024</a>.” Will the robots make us more human? This <b>flood of authorless 'content' will help truly authored creativity shine</b> in contrast.” </p>
					
					<p>Perhaps. But <b>in the absence of an unhackable and ungameable system of identity and authenticity, how can we distinguish between the authentic and the synthetic</b>?</p>
					
					<h2>What’s to be done? Can trust technology save authentic journalism and preserve the epistemic commons?</h2>
					
					
					<p>Few people know that the internet even has a trust infrastructure. The bedrock of Internet trust, <b>Web PKI, is inadequate, outdated, and poorly governed</b>. Beyond encrypting traffic to web sites, it delivers very little value to the average user of the internet. As such, it has done little to prevent the crisis of trust that afflicts the Internet as a whole, but especially social media platforms. In our emerging AI-generated digital reality, <b>the crisis of authenticity threatens to become even more acute</b>.</p>

					<p>PKI stands for "public key infrastructure". In its general use, it helps us know that we are sending our credit card information to a server controlled by the legal entity Amazon, Inc. It also encrypes that traffic so it cannot be read by a third party. Its limitation? It can't tell you whether you trust the specific content presented on a given web page. In other words, it's no help in distinguishing whether an article, a graphic, or a video was created by <b>a human that you trust</b>, or is simply an <b>AI generated hallucination</b>.</p>
											
						<p>Even industry stalwarts, whose businesses are based on selling PKI to huge enterprise companies, are commenting on the gap in their existing products, as the need for identity and provenance will become the foundation for <b>content authenticity</b>.</p>
						
<p>As far back as 2014, Moxie Marlinspike pointed out the need for an alternative to Web PKI in his seminal talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawS3_iuHoA">SSL and the Future of Authenticity</a>. </p>
					
					 <iframe width="420" height="315" align="center"
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UawS3_iuHoA?t=286">
					</iframe>

					<p>The problem is that you can’t have trust without identity and authenticity. As an industry we’ve invested huge amounts of time and effort into authentication and access control, and so-called identity and access management, for humans. What we have completely ignored is authentication for the “content” produced by those humans. We've secured the software supply chain, and the physical supply chain, giving no thought to <b>securing the digital media supply chain</b>.</p>

					<p>Noosphere Technologies' goal is to level the playing field between humans and robots. We are <b>unbundling and democratizing PKI</b> to make its power available to everyone who needs a recourse to authentic information. </p>
					
						<p>We’re building API-first services that make trust relationships transparent and manageable for non-technical people. To accomplish this, we’re building trust infrastructure, trust protocols, and trust services that enable trust agility -- putting <b>the power to curate trust relationship in the hands of everyone on the internet</b>.</p>	
						
						<p>Ultimately, we are transforming internet trust from <b>public key infrastruture</b> to something new, what we call <b>public key intelligence&#8482;</b>. It's an audacious goal, but we have the experience and the know-how to do it. We simply need allies and force multipliers to make this vision a reality.</p>
